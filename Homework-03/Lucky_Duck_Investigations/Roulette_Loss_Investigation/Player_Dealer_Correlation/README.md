# J. Morgan Lieberthal - Homework 3

## Notes

The scripts `roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh` and
`roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh` are designed to be run in the
directory containing dealer schedules. To specify a different directory to run
the script in, use the `-d` option.

For usage instructions, please run each script with the `-h` option to output
help messages.

Note that the script `find_all_dealers.sh` corresponds to the generation of the
`Dealers_working_during_losses` file, and the script `find_all_losses.sh`
corresponds to the generation of the `Roulette_Losses` file. See the comments at
the top of each script for usage instructions.
