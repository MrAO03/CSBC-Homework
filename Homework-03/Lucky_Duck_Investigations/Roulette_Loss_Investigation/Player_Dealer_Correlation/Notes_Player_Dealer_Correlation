# Notes: Player/Dealer Correlation

I believe the player **Mylie Schmidt** is colluding with the dealer
**Billy Jones** to scam the Lucky Duck casino. The dealer was working every time
a major loss occurred, and the player was at the table each time.

The dealer and player were both present when major losses occurred, and are most
likely responsible for the major losses.
