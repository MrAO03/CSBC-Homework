## Homework 17 - Penetration Testing

> :warning: Heads-up: My VM ran out of hours on Sunday so I couldn't complete
> the assignment then. I messaged Andrew on Slack as soon as it happened, and he
> requested more hours for me, and told me if the hours were not ready in time
> I could just turn in the homework when they were there. Due to the holiday on
> Monday, I didn't receive the additional hours until late afternoon / early
> evening on Tuesday, and I completed the assignment as soon as possible. [Proof
> if you need it](./Images/hours-proof.png).
